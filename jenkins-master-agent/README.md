# Steps and their meaning for extending the file system
nvme0n1 is a physical disk on EC2.

nvme0n1p1 through nvme0n1p4 are physical partitions on the nvme0n1 physical disk.

RootVG-rootVol is a logical volume (LV), which is the root directory of your Linux filesystem (/). This LV resides within a larger container called a Volume Group (RootVG), which itself is a single partition (nvme0n1p4).

Expand the partition (nvme0n1p4) to use all available disk space: 

## sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 4.

This step is correct and necessary to expand the physical container that holds the LVM-managed volumes.

Expand the logical volume: You must now extend the logical volume (RootVG-rootVol) to use the newly allocated space

Use 

## sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/RootVG-rootVol. 
This will expand the logical volume to take up all the free space you just added to the RootVG volume group.

## lvextend -L +20G /dev/mapper/RootVG/rootVol
## lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/RootVG/varVol


Resize the filesystem: 

## sudo xfs_growfs /
## xfs_growfs /var

It makes the newly expanded logical volume space usable by the operating system.

sudo lvextend -L +5G /dev/mapper/RootVG-varVol

# Analogy Refined

Physical Disk (nvme0n1): A big empty warehouse.

Partition (nvme0n1p4): A large room you build inside the warehouse.

Volume Group (RootVG): A department within that room, which manages all the storage for a specific purpose (in your case, the OS).

Logical Volume (RootVG-rootVol): The specific section of shelves and floor space within that department that is used for the root filesystem.

growpart: Making the "room" (nvme0n1p4) bigger to use all the "warehouse" (nvme0n1) space.

lvextend: Re-configuring the "department" (RootVG) to expand the "root filesystem shelves" (RootVG-rootVol) into the new space you just added.

xfs_growfs: Telling the librarian (the filesystem) to update their catalog to include the new shelves, so you can actually place new books on them
